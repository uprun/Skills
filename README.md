# Skills
A dotnet 2.0 C# project for managing skills.
The idea behind this project is that I want to keep track of progress in learning some topic, 
but time to time I forget what I have learnt and usually do not keep links to articles which I already read.
And I have a lot of topics in which I am interested in, so I would like to see them all grouped in one place.

#1 idea is to have a record of steps that I have done in process of learning some skill and then just to provide these steps to someone who is interested in same skill.
