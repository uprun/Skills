# Skills
A dotnet 2.0 C# project for managing skills.
The idea behind this project is that I want to keep track of progress in learning some topic, 
but time to time I forget what I have learnt and usually do not keep links to articles which I already read.
And I have a lot of topics in which I am interested in, so I would like to see them all grouped in one place.

#1 idea is to have a record of steps that I have done in process of learning some skill and then just to provide these steps to someone who is interested in same skill.

#2 idea is to play with code and come up with some mix of kanban board and notes with tags which I can search through using some query language, like LINQ.

#3 idea is to have some web-based programming environment so I don't need to install any additional software to test my idea, and it should be super easy to start new project.

#4 idea is that I am tired of inconsistent database and code states like you make some change in database and then code breaks because you deleted/changed type of some column and you then need to fix code as soon as possible because your application just does not work --> so I think that better to have immutable data and classes that is why there are nodes in my project which are representation of virtual memory.

And all these ideas I want to mix in this project will see what will be at finish of it.
