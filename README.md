#TLDR; I created syntax tree editor .. one more time :D

# Note to myself: try to boil down ideas to one sentence.

you just build your code as a syntax tree.

a new source control system embedded in code.

How it all began:
------------------------------------------



#2 idea is to play with code and come up with some mix of kanban board and notes with tags which I can search through using some query language, like LINQ.

#3 idea is to have some ~~web-based~~ programming environment so I don't need to install any additional software to test my idea, and it should be super easy to start new project.

#4 idea is that I am tired of inconsistent database and code states 

I think that better to have immutable data and classes that is why there are nodes in my project which are representation of virtual memory.

#5 idea is that it should be something trully visual programming 

#6 idea is that it should be a all kind of knowledge base, it should support research process, programming and have history of changes.

#8 if all above will be implemented then one optimization idea is to generate code straight from node representation.

Inspired by graph knowledge AI labs in Odesa National University.
